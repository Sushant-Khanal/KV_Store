# KV_Store

**KV_Store** is a simple implementation of a Key-Value store written in Go. This project is created as a learning resource to help individuals understand the Go programming language and the core principles behind Key-Value stores.

## About the Project

A Key-Value store is a type of database that uses a simple key-value pair for storing and retrieving data. It serves as the foundation of modern caching and storage mechanisms. This implementation is designed to demonstrate the following concepts:

1. **Basic Operations**: How to store, retrieve, and delete key-value pairs.
2. **Data Structures**: The use of data structures like maps or hash tables in Go for efficient data retrieval.
3. **Go Programming Concepts**: A hands-on approach to learning Go syntax, standard libraries, and program structure.

This is an ideal project for anyone looking to learn Go while exploring the fundamentals of Key-Value stores.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- [Go Programming Language](https://go.dev/): Ensure Go is installed on your system.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sushant-Khanal/KV_Store.git
   cd KV_Store
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if any):

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

This will execute the basic implementation of the Key-Value store. You can start adding more functionality or modify the code as you learn.

## Project Structure

- **`main.go`**: Contains the main entry point and the implementation of the Key-Value store.
- Additional files and functions can be added as the project evolves.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how Key-Value stores work.
- Learn the fundamentals of Go programming.
- Gain experience in building simple, functional systems from scratch.
